# 💡 Password Creation Tips

Based on testing various passwords, here are the most important practices for creating strong passwords:

## ✅ Do:
- Use at least 12–16 characters
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Add numbers and special characters (!@#% etc.)
- Use passphrases (e.g., `Green$Tiger#42Dance`)
- Make each password unique for every account

## ❌ Don't:
- Use common passwords (`password123`, `qwerty`, etc.)
- Use personal info (birthdays, names)
- Reuse passwords across sites
- Use predictable substitutions (e.g., `P@ssw0rd`)

## 🔐 Password Managers:
- Help generate and store complex passwords
- Reduce reuse and improve security hygiene

## 🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
- Adds a second layer of protection beyond the password
- Use MFA wherever available

## 🛡 Common Password Attacks:
- **Brute Force**: Trying all possible combinations
- **Dictionary Attack**: Trying commonly used passwords/words
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using stolen passwords from data breaches
